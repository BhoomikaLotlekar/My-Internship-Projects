We had to protect their name, and as well, we had to protect ours. This is a Roc-A-Fella, Wu Tang, and a Ruff Ryder presentation. We got together and did this. I don't think you set out to make history. - It just happens. - Is there a concern... that throughout the tour there might be a clash of egos? If it does happen, I don't think it will be within this table. We all grown men, first of all, with a job to do, so-- We're responsible individuals.

Something to make it more accessible. I'd tell them, see us after we sell three million records. Then we want to do our own tour. A lot of cats told us it just couldn't happen. When the opportunity came, they're like who do you want to tour with?

[ Interviewer ] Why are you guys all so infatuated with gangster flicks? We just watched Good Will Huntingjust now. That's not a gangster flick. There might not be another hip-hop tour like this if there's any violence. We got As Good as It Gets. We got Braveheart. You know what I'm saying? See that? This is the kind of shit we watch. Not all gangster movies. Know what I'm saying? So no more of them questions. [ Interviewer ] But you're not rapping about Good Will Hunting. That man was just crying over Titanic, and that's a true story. I felt real bad about Titanic. I was crying. Hey, I wasn't crying like a bitch. Yeah, we gonna fire back at you in a minute. We want all our questions answered. We was on tour with Everclear and Soul Coughing. I just found out it's normal... to have the mosh pit at these white rock shows. And people jump in. They dive and they lose sneakers. They break their arms, break they legs. You know, they hit the floor. They come out muddy. And it's normal. The paramedics is there. The stretcher is there. You get hurt, they wheel you out. It's okay. They got insurance. At a hip-hop show, if that was to happen, they'd shut it down. Everybody's making money now, and that's a positive. Everybody's making money, man. The way we grew up, and shit-- [ Laughing ]That-That made us into who we are. Like, if he was living in the suburbs, or something, he probably wouldn't be no rapper. He'd probably be struggling, looking for a job. Same with Jay-Z. If Jay-Z wasn't in Marcy, lived in the suburbs, he probably wouldn't be no rapper. He probably wouldn't be a multimillionaire today. He'd probably be struggling for a job. That's what did it for him. [ Indistinct Talking ]Yeah, your fuckin' fault. Hold these.

I'm not really overwhelmed with none of it. It's always gonna be a struggle. As long as you black, it's gonna be a hustle. After you, gentlemen. [ Barking ] This is like personal personalsecurity.

You know, I'm a kid. I want to run with my dogs, you know? Things like that. Drive my car. I want you to try to help me bring my dog out. [ Audience Cheering ] I pray before the show.

So everything I love is on my arms. Damon D-Dash. [ Nonsense ] Get a shot of his box head.That's right. I'm gonna pop out. Damon Dash.That motherfucker... is the motherfucking nigga, boy. No! He's coming! He's coming! Damon Dash and I went to prep school together. \"Nigga, you went to boarding school.\" Like that takes anything away from my credibility or my validity in the street. I'm like, \"Yeah, nigga, I put myself in boarding school.\" I seen them go from handing me... a record out of they trunk to where they are right now. I remember I went to this party, and I'm seeing these niggas... partying and having a ball, buying champagne, and I was, like, these niggas didn't even put half the work I put in. They don't have to take half the risks I put in. I got to come get this money. Most common thing you hear about Damon is he a asshole. I'm gonna try to put my foot in the door arguing points. They're giving me the nigga deal. Motherfuckers call me a asshole every day. I don't listen to that shit. My crew tells me what's right, and I respect them. How come they keep saying Def Jam, Def Jam all through these reviews? He don't give a fuck about nothing but Roc-A-Fella. No mention of Roc-A-Fella putting together the tour. It's all Def Jam. He's the last person you want on your ass. If you ain't with Roc, then he don't give a fuck about you. You're telling me exactly why I don't really fuck with Def Jam. Because every time we get next to y'all, they get the credit. We own our own company. We look like artists. That's Damon Dash in a nutshell. Roc-A-Fella or fuck you. Bleek, man. Yo, Bleek. You got a jacket over there, all right? See this jacket? Shit. You see the Memphis Bleek? I didn't never have a Roc-A-Fella coat that said Memphis Bleek. This the only thing Def Jam got one up on. But other than that, Roc-A-Fella is the home. Oh, my God. He just dropped that one. [ Dash ] All of a sudden, it's Def Jam jackets... with niggas' names on them all over the tour. Damon.That shit is weak, man. You ain't pimp doing that. Everybody wants a jacket. You wanna do something, make a motherfucker Hard Knock Life Tour jacket. We don't want this shit. Why do I need Beanie and Memphis Bleek wearing a Def Jam jacket? They're on Roc-A-Fella. All a sudden, he's got jackets with they names on on our tour. It makes it look like a Def Jam tour. Damon--All right, look. You're president of a company, right? That means you're smart. Am I right? So don't sit there and play dumb. Now, wait. If everybody on this tour has a Def Jam jacket on, what would be the general perception of this, when people just walking around and don't know nothing. What would it look like? People would think it's a Def Jam tour. So then, knowing this, why wouldn't you be extra sensitive... about giving everybody Def Jam jackets on this tour? Why? Why? You're president, and you know. So either you real smart, or you real dumb. It's one or the other. And I'm not gonna say that you real dumb. I'm gonna say you real smart. So you know better. You all know better. Hi. What's going on? So you guys wanna find out what's on the official Def Jam tour bus? All right, come on up. We'll see what's going on in here. It's like y'all put motherfucking Def Jam presents... Def Jam's Hard Knock Life on Russell Simmons' show. That what's up? That's-- How is that a mistake? How is that a mistake? Because Russell decides what's in every single thing that comes up. So you're saying Russell-- The person that-- fucked up, doesn't know that this is not his tour? He don't know that?No, he knows that, but-- So wait. All right, the people at his company don't know that? Right. Maybe not.Maybe not? If that's the case, that means the general public don't know that. The Def Jam tour bus consists of nine video screens. We've got digital curtains. Let the curtains down. Let 'em check the curtains as they go down. Those little mistakes you make-- Just because you're not trying to, those mistakes are making it so that it looks like it's your tour. Sometimes you get tired of pulling curtains on tour, so thought we'd get some electronic curtains. Hey, look, y'all niggas are too fucking professional, and you're too smart to make these kind of dumb-ass mistakes. You all right? Sony wouldn't do this. [ Indistinct ] ...gets his props. RCA don't take that. Bad Boy gets his prop. Arista don't take that. The Face gets his prop. Y'all gotta have your fucking face in everything we do. Then I gotta be the asshole and yell. I don't feel like doing that shit all the time. I'm sick of that shit. Yo, 30% of my day goes to correcting your fucking mistakes. Y'all gonna pay me more for that? It is true, man.That's false. That's Lester's towel. That's Big Lester's towel. That's not my towel. The thing I told you when I came here... is that we don't want to get overshadowed by fucking Def Jam's name, by Russell Simmons and by your logo. I was guaranteed it wouldn't, and it's exactly the opposite. And you're not doing nothing to stop it. You know how you do? You give everybody fucking Def Jam jackets. This is our cool-out area. We watch TV. Uh-- Play Nintendo 65. Hey, whoa, whoa! Please don't take an act of love-- That ain't no love, man. That's promotion. Yo, who do you think you're talking to? Understand? That's basically the inside of the Def Jam tour bus. All I need y'all to do is cut the checks. That's it. We're taking all the chances. We're the ones that boycott the Grammys. We're the ones that motherfucking put our ass on the line and did this tour, and we still don't get the credit for it. Why not?I don't know why. 'Cause your fucking fat ass is around all the time. Hey! Hey! Hey! [ Liles ] Every time we talk,That's bullshit. it seems like we partners.We not partners. [ Laughs ] That's good from you to say that. We ain't partners.What are we then? Y'all cut us checks. Y'all got 25% and what's her name has another 25%. But you're not equal partners. You don't think I know that? What do you mean?You and Polygraph split 50%. Absolutely.All right. So you're not partners. You got a quarter. You a quarter owner. That's it. Good, man. And that's what happens when you're on tour... with the Hard Knock Life, Def Jam Records! I think the hip-hop audience grew up a lot. It's a different time period. That's all. I started listening to hip-hop when I was 10. Now our kids is growing up listening to hip-hop. I think we matured a lot. What happened to Big and 'Pac, hip-hop community's just tired of the bullshit. Now hip-hop is so multicultural. Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese-- I think we can do tours like U2 does... and be on tour for two years. The new artists nowadays understand the business aspect. And the new artists right now are getting paid. We definitely gonna profit off of our music. And the way they going about doing that... is not being a slave to the record company, like Jay-Z has Roc-A-Fella. It's not just Def Jam signin' Jay-Z. Def Jam had to take Roc-A-Fella Records. We all strive to get some ownership... and to get our own labels. [ Lover ] It's like Ruff Ryders and DMX. It's a opportunity for them all to own something. To own their masters, to be the ones 10 years from now... puttin' out them compilation albums oftheir records... andthem gettin' the money from it. Look how far we came from 10 years ago to now. Just think about 10 years from now. N.Y.C., baby. Only thing about this, I just wish we'd been able... to end it on New York. You know what I'm saying? 'Cause that's your home town. I just wish-- I got a feelin' we comin' here too-- too soon. My nigga black, live on the phone from Clinton. Now me on the cell. How ill is that? [ Man Speaks, Indistinct ] Yeah, yeah. Know what I mean? And it's nothin', it's nothin'. We live, niggas. This is real shit. Blink, I heard you scared of Blinky Blink. Nigga, you see that?[ Laughter ] Nigga, that thing gonna batter you. You scared. You been hidin' from that nigga. That's EZ TV. What the fuck. That's right, Hard Knock. [ Chattering ] All right then. My boys right here. Part of the crew? Part of the crew? I wanna know why I'm not on the fuckin' tour. Because I'm the one that do all the voices, you know? \"Fuck You, Pay Me\". Uh-- Okay, okay. So now we got the guy who wants to work for Jay-Z. Any problems, he can go to Jay-Z. Yeah? That's you?Fuck you-- Yeah, that's me. Think I'm fuckin' lyin'? Only thing, they didn't bring me on the tour. I can't mess with that dude, man. I'm serious. I tried and I tried. I can't mess with him. Where's the Jay-Z locker room? I gotta talk to this prick. Right there, babe.All right. ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ] Gimme the fuckin' camera. What the fuck is-- Why didn't you bring me on the fuckin' tour? That's what I want to know. What the fuck is wrong with you not bringing-- That's the prick you gotta talk to, says I'm not on the fuckin' tour. For the sake of hip-hop, I couldn't take him on the tour, 'cause he'd probably end it. I'd probably fuck it all up. Fuck it up. Fighting, shit like that. He's like this tall, and I can't do it. I can't do it. \"Fuck You, Pay Me.\" That's the name of my new tune. That's my man, though.That's right, that's right. Hey, check it out. I got a new saying. Check it out. Go like this. From here on in, nothing goes down unless I'm involved. No albums, no dope deals, no nothing. A concert goes on in the park, I want in.

I'm gonna get my dick sucked by every woman on this planet. Okay? Fuck that. Turn off the camera, 'cause I'm gonna look stupid eating a sandwich. Peace. My shit cost a hundred dollars. And mine cost-- Mine cost a hundred thousand. See, that's the thing.[ Laughing ] When you're on a tour and you're performing, do you ever get horny? 'Cause when I'm on stage, I get real horny. I don't know. A little bit, you know, all that Gucci shit kinda... That's what I'm saying.get me a little hot. When you look in the crowd, and you're horny... and you're lookin' at the people while you're performing, you say, \"I could fuck one of these people.\" Right? [ Laughing ]Because-- Because that's what it's all about. It's about power. When you on that stage, it's about power. Fuck Damon. He bigger than that. [ Loud Laughter ]On camera.

Sick of this shit! But I'm not gon' quit! I been ready to go back to Philly off this tour... about two, two and a half months ago. Nah. My first two weeks, I was lovin' it. After that-- I been tired. [ Dash ] You gotta keep doin' it even when you're tired. I'm exhausted. On this tour, I flew home every Monday. The day-- Every day off we had, I flew home, no matter where we was at, West Coast, wherever. But I gotta do it, because a lot of people depend on me. You know what I'm saying? Unload the bags off the bus. Check into the hotel. Burn up. Go to the show. Be backstage for three hours. Runnin' around backstage, drinkin', smokin'. Doin' whatever you do. Perform. Go to the after-party. Go to the hotel. Might get two hours of sleep. Back up, packing your stuff. Get back on the bus. Go to the next town. Do that all over again. Every day. [ Redman ] During the day when we ridin', this bitch be packed. That shit be packed like a dick in this motherfucker. I be, like, \"Damn.\" Niggas be in the front, in the middle, back. Feet be everywhere. Shoes-- This is the cleanest this motherfuckin' bus been since the whole tour. 'Cause the bus driver-- You gotta have a good, sensible bus driver. Our bus driver name is-- We got, uh, three different buses. Me and Jay bus was fancy. I don't know. 'Cause our shit was kinda clean, though we had cupcakes and shit. ♪♪ [ Operatic Aria ] No smokin', no drinkin'. Yo shit was the rehab bus. [ Man On Radio, Indistinct ] Then you had Rykers Island. Check me out from head to toe. I'm really a California nigga. You know what I mean? Cutoff khakis, French braids, house shoes, nigga. [ Horn Honking ]Hey, what's that? Yo, Murder! Yo, Murder, what you doing, man? No! Nobody tell me what the fuck to do. Stupid. You-- First off, you go on that bus, you gotta smoke. Just put the flash together. - I'm gonna see you. - Don't make me put my cereal down. Fuck you. You gotta know how to fight. - La-la-la-la. - [ Screaming ] Stop it! Fuckin' smack the shit outta you.Shut the fuck up. Wasn't talkin' to you. Drive, nigga. Bring me one of my Jerry Springer tapes. Yo, listen up. Yo, this door gotta be closed. Yo, fuckin' just let anybody drive a fuckin' bus?Fuck you. Breaker, breaker.This is nobody's bitch, baby. Roc-A-Fella's official bus driver now. You bitch nigga! Then there's the Vikings. That's Clue bus. Them niggas-- That was the hole.That was the most-- - They had no food, electricity-- - That was the hole. What exactly is the problem though? Gimme the keys.You got to drive this shit. How low is the fuckin' generator? This is fucked up.The job will get done. Real shit.This is a minor setback. Got that lock shit. Lock it up. - [ Door Closes ] - We out. EZ, you and your fuckin' camera... and your lights and your mike. We'll fuck EZ up after this tour.Ho-fuckin'-tel. We goin' to the after-party.After the tour's over, we gonna fuck EZ up, 'cause he taped all the bad moments. Lenny, you are a piece of shit. [ Chattering ] I'm tired of y'all motherfuckin' camera motherfuckers... all up my ass all fuckin' day. I don't need that love. Through the tour, we've almost become a family. [ Arguing ] Give me shit.Yo, back up. Shit. You try and act like a bitch. You called upstairs and that was it! I haven't been on a tour this mellow backstage in a long time. What the fuck? Hey, nigga. You walked into it.I didn't throw it. It was a accident, it was a accident.Yo, yo, yo. It was an accident. They was only playing.Gimme a tissue or something. You know, entourages are gettin' along and the groups. There's no drama here at all.We are one big family out here. [ Dash ] If I don't get the tape, enough for the GR, y'all not gonna look like you're equal partners in this. So then it's gonna look like we made it look like a Roc-A-Fella thing, as opposed to a Ruff Ryders, Roc-A-Fella thing. ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ][ Indistinct ] Say bye-bye. He's now a hostage. So we have the Dash.Mr. Dash himself. Just for that, we want four dollars. No feedin' the prisoners. [ Laughing, Shrieking ] No, you don't. Huh? Where you goin'? Ah! Ah! [ Indistinct Shouting ] They got all their big cats and y'all up here signing autographs. Who we got?We got a job. I'm not playing here. You see this? Think it's a phone, don't you? Huh-uh. You thought it was a phone. You know what it is? It's a remote control for a fuckin' bomb. Dawg, you got 10 minutes. Ten fucking minutes to say something about something... that'll break something to somewhere or I'm telling you-- [ Beeps ]That's boom. ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ] [ Laughing, Shrieking ] Yo, where we going? Pull it down![ Screaming ] Yeah! [ Laughing ] We all one big family. We're on that paper chase. Whoever on my team, anybody on my team smilin', I'm gonna shoot you. From now on, I want the game face on! Yeah, I'm ready to kill somebody. You know? Huh? My gun is in, uh-- in storage right now. ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ] [ Shooting ] That's us, man. That's us! [ Chanting ] Nigga, what? Shoot the blue! Nigga, what? Shoot the blue! Nigga, what? Shoot the blue! So I told him, man. He lazy, man. Doing the Hard Knock Life tour album. They beefin' 'cause we ain't got nothin' really done. Only like three songs done. So they beefin' right now, but-- I wanna get a song--What's with that? I gotta make a beat like that.You been sayin' you been makin' beats-- No, no, no, no. I wanna make--Every day for four weeks. All of them beats--I gotta go. [ Laughing ] Fuck them, 'cause they don't know what's goin' on. To the funniest lookin' nigga in America, man. Even his face can't, so he made it to the circus. It was like-- My government name is David Banner, A.K.A. the world-famous DJ Clue. Queens native. From his chin to right here is all fucked up. I open the show. Get the crowd hyped. You play records on the tour. When his needle break, he just put his chin on it. DJ Clue is driving me crazy. - Nothing gets done till Clue feels like he's ready. - Temper tantrums. He used to hit with a mallet when he was fuckin'-- [ Clicks Tongue ] How do you get a fade, Afro, Caesar, all in one day, man? He got Caesar waves right here. He got two little-- He got a blow out in it right here. Oh, wow.Right? Then he got-- he got a fade in the back. He gonna rep for all your boroughs, okay? People hate him, but he's ill. He's the highest selling mixtape DJ ever. It went platinum. [ Dash ] We try to do an album from the road, and just trying to get him to focus and get artists... from after the show to on his bus to lay down a song. God feels like, \"Yo, Clue, let's go.\" He's like, \"Yo, God, you gotta hold up.\" When Clue wants somethin', don't he go to any means necessary? That nigga turns into Malcolm X. He'll go into any hood, like, \"Yo, you got the what's-you-call-it?\" - He don't give a fuck. - Niggas don't work that hard. Now he wanna knock on the door, like, \"Yo, can I go to the studio?\" I see a lot of artists, when they weren't on, when they didn't have they records... and they was shoppin' demos, they was hungry. Then, as soon as they sell a record, they don't wanna do nothin'. Niggas don't want to sit in the studio. You got to put pressure on. How could you get in the music business and want to be successful... and not know that you're gonna have to do these things? - The Matrix got us all fooled. - Fuck the Matrix. Right now gonna be our worst times right now. The best of times should be when we all got the big $10 million houses, the stash and all the Bentleys, and all that shit. Now we like, \"Well, can't get no better than this.\" Yeah.That's when we good. I'm serious, man. We're gonna fuckin' lose it, man. The difference between being in the audience and being backstage, man. Knockin' on the door. Nah, I can't do it. I'm so scared. You know, the Matrix got us. Clue was the pinnacle of the show, I tell you right now. Clue was a sign that, yo, this shit can happen to everybody, man. The Matrix. It's a sweet hustle, but it's a fucked up hustle. Man, music business is crazy. [ Chattering ] ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ] Take it over to the bus, y'all. They can't make no fuckin' tape on that bus. This was on that fuckin' bus. We got to talk to Clue, man. They gotta make tapes and give them to people... so they get on the bus and lay they vocals. It's in the can. You know, we can win this time. Really win. [ Elevator Bell Dings ]I don't know about the album. [ Skane ] We get a lot of pressure from him. I can't blame him. About this album, 'cause shit is kind of movin' slow. Every day he's on my ass, like, \"Y'all bullshittin'. Y'all need to do this. You need to do that.\" I don't wanna be, like, \"Shut the fuck up.\" You know what I'm saying? 'Cause he's loud, but he's fuckin' 100% correct. Nobody wants to get on the bus. Everyone wants to go to the after-parties. I don't want to overstep my bounds as far as talking for Desert Storm... or trying to push some structure, but from what I see-- ♪♪ [ Hip-hop ]Like I know you got a lot of niggas, like a lot of soldiers and shit. You got a lot of shit you gotta do. Turn that shit down. Why you doin' that, man? That's your problem. Every time we talk, you get like a whatchacall. I'm tryin' to talk for real. I don't understand that. That's the problem. You do so many things. You can't do everything on your own. If you do, by the time you do it, you could have did 30 other things if you had help. You understand what I'm saying? Like you can't do a album and be on the radio on Monday... and then do a party and three parties a week... and nothin's gonna get done right or nothin's gonna get done quick. So if you got niggas willing to help you, it's the time to teach y'all how to do it. You don't want to be in the music business? We all know that this nigga's very, very distant... and you can't depend on him to make somethin' happen. He's on his own plane. So you have to-- Fuck it. I gotta be annoying for your career. You know what I'm saying? Like, \"Look, Clue, I need to do this,\" or whatever, and just do it. The thing is, it's not one nigga that should be the head of a crew. It should never be one nigga the head of a crew, 'cause if that nigga ever goes, if he ever goes to jail or, God forbid, he gets killed... or something happen, the whole crew goes down. Because everybody depends on one nigga. You over. But let's say, you're equal, you're equal and you're equal. If, let's say, you fall off, he can give you a little, your man can give you a little... and it's not gonna break you to put your man back on. You can't run no company without no fuckin' crew, man. And what better fuckin' crew to have than the niggas you grew up with? You should depend on him like he depends on you... and y'all should depend on each other. But you have to be bigger than just Clue. Desert Storm should mean more than Clue. When niggas think of Roc-A-Fella, it's not only Jay-Z they think about. It's not only me they think about. They think of a whole movement and what we represent. Because niggas know that ever since we got in the game, every nigga down with me had money. If every nigga has just as much as you got, what kind of crew you got? You got a crew that can't be touched. That's how crews crumble, because they don't feel they gettin' a piece. Every nigga I know that was gettin' money, they own crew took 'em down. They the niggas that shut them niggas up, 'cause they not eatin' enough. And you can't-- That's the nigga's nature. Man, this thing got made. I'm going back to the projects. Don't tell us that shit. We got niggas missin' behind that. All right then. That's what you do. That's-- That's why niggas snitch on niggas... and that's why niggas kill niggas... and that's why niggas get niggas shut up, because they not being treated fairly. God bless my fuckin' nigga, but he missin' 'cause of that shit. None of that shit happens in my crew. None of that shit. So on the count of three, I want everybody in this building to say peace. One, two, three. [ Explosion ] At least 18 people are being treated... as a result of injuries sustained in the shooting attack... at Columbine High School. You know, X, he came into the dressing room. We had the same idea. You know the tragedy that happened in the next town, Littleton, we say we're donating all the proceeds... from the concert to the families of the victims. [ Audience Cheering ] Violent behavior-- it's more shocking... to see it happen in a place like Littleton than Brooklyn, but it-- it's all the same, man. It was out of respect. It was either cancel the show or donate the proceeds. We chose the latter. They just needed a outlet, somewhere to go and just scream. You know, not like you gonna forget about it, but, you know, to get it out. [ Crying ] Come here, child. I'm starting to get into a new way of thinkin' about, um, rap music and shit. Because of all the stereotypes. [ Crying ] Hey, sweet little baby. What is that? Gimme-- You want this? You want me to have it? This is the ultimate shit to have everything... and only certain artists have the quality. 'Cause Jay messin' with you and I ain't havin' that. Come on, come on. You ready to go home? I don't always do the right thing. But I ask you to forgive me. Because I need you here with me. Without you in my life, it's empty. Big had it, 'Pac had it. Certain artists had it. Like they had love that was strong. Think back how some people did me, like, violence was the remedy. Because I think of that now, I will pray for my enemy. It's more like a movement with Jay and X. It was a movement with 'Pac and Big. And you can feel that 'cause the movement's still going. To me, that's what makes a artist special. When you live for somethin'. When you stand for somethin'.
